**For game**: [7 Days to Die](https://7daystodie.com)

**Description:**
Additional prefabs to load up into a RWG game, created by yours truly!
Note: Some prefabs may be "inspired" by existing prefabs (read: I used them
as a starting point).  Unless credit is given, they will be from vanilla prefabs

Note: I am trying to make these "compopack" compatible, meaning I am trying to
follow the rules/requirements for them to be eventually added to the compopack.
So these POIs shouldn't be "unbalanced" too far from what POI's are expected to
be.

Note: You may want to adjust the spawning percentage in rwgmixer.xml.  I default
all prefab spawning to 5%, which I have not tested to see if this is appropriate.

Current Prefabs:
